Repository for robot code for the 2017 FRC season

NOTA BENE -- This is the src/ folder, not the full eclipse project. Rather than cloning, create a new WPILib project in eclipse, then execute the following commands:
```
cd <your eclipse project>/src
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/FRCTeam1719/2017Robot.git
git pull origin master
git push -u origin master:master
```
